## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
    See images folder
-   The data structure you plan to use.
    As of right now I plan to use a series of arrays to emulat coordinates on the game board.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    I am still trying to figure out how to represent the board in JS.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
    Not really sure yet. I will take a methodical approach and code things one at a time. Focus on one problem and solve it, once that is done I can move on. I will save what I think to be the easiest things for last. I plan on utlizing my resources. I have a friend who studied computer science in college and a friend who graduated from Launch Academy. I also plan on utilizing the resources in the glass that have already been a huge help. From what I have seen, all developers are great at the lead learning out strategy which encourages exploration and effective learning.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    As a user I want a clear and concise sign up and login
    As a user I want to be able to start a game easily
    As a user I want easy to use functionality
    As a user I want to be able to play on multiple devices
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    I plan on using the same structure we used the past two days in class that requires multiple Atom files to keep the code tidy.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    For now I aim to keep the project bare bones, I want it to work before I add any frills
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    Commit early and often! I don't think version control will play a mjor role in this project but I do think that when I want to lool back at my progress in the future looking back at my commits will be interesting.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    Probs not.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
